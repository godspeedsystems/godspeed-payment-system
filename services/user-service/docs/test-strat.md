# Test Strategy Document

## 1. Objective
Ensure the reliability of user registration by providing comprehensive test coverage for the `registerUserToDB` event handler.

## 2. Testing Framework: Mocha + Chai

## 3. Test Coverage: 80%

## 4. Test Directory Structure

test/
├── eventHandlers/           # Tests for each event handler
├── helpers/                 # Utility functions for testing
│   ├── makeContext.ts       # Creates mock GSContext
│   └── makeEvent.ts         # Creates mock event payloads
└── hooks/globalSetup.ts     # Setup code to run before all tests

## 5. In Scope
- **Event Handlers**:  
  For each event handler, a corresponding test file will be created.  
  - Source: `src/functions`
  - Input for test generation:
    - Summary in event file
    - Comments in function code
    - Actual code logic
    - TRD descriptions (if available)
    - Event schema definitions
  - Test cases will include:
    - Valid inputs
    - Invalid inputs (missing/incorrect fields)
    - Output structure matching response schema (status code-specific)
    - Response validation using Ajv

- The LLM should skip writing tests for event handlers if:
  - No summary is found in both event file and TRD.
  - These events should be listed in a `skippedTests` section at the end of this document.

## 6. Out of Scope
- Internal utility/helper functions
- End-to-end flows involving frontend or full stack
- Input schema validation (already enforced by Godspeed’s event schema)

## 7. EventHandlers
- registerUserToDB:
    - Should register a new user successfully with valid input.
    - Should return an error if the email is already registered.
    - Should handle database connection errors gracefully.
    - Should validate input data against a schema.

## 8. Skipped Event Handlers
[...] (automatically updated)

COMPLIANCE NOTES:
- Never overwrite existing test files—append only.
- Log skipped handlers with reasons.
- Validate all responses using Ajv and match them against status-specific schemas.
- Follow naming and folder conventions strictly.
- Do not assume logic—derive it from code, summary, TRD, and schema only.
